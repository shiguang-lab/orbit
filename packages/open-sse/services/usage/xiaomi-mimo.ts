 * usage/xiaomi-mimo.ts — Xiaomi MiMo self-tracked monthly quota fetcher.
 *
 * Extracted from services/usage.ts (god-file decomposition): the Xiaomi MiMo family —
 * Xiaomi exposes plan usage only behind the console session cookie (the API key
 * cannot reach the `tokenPlan/usage` endpoint), so ShiguangGateway self-tracks the
 * tokens it routed to the connection in the current UTC month (from usage_history)
 * and compares them to the known Token Plan monthly limit. Depends only on the
 * sibling scalar/quota leaves + the usageStats dynamic import — no host coupling
 * — so it lives as a co-located provider leaf. usage.ts imports getXiaomiMimoUsage
 * (dispatcher + __testing). Behavior-preserving move.
